# Genetic Drawing
This is a toy project I did around 2017 for imitating a drawing process given a target image (inspired by many examples of genetic drawing on the internet, and this was my take on it, mostly as an exercise). 

Due to a popular request, it is now opensource ðŸ™‚

Examples of generated images:

![](imgs/img1.gif) <img src="imgs/img2.gif" width="380">

It also supports user-created sampling masks, in case you'd like to specify regions where more brushstrokes are needed (for ex, to allocate more finer details)


<img src="imgs/img3.gif">


## Python
you would need the following python 3 libraries:

* opencv 3.4.1
* numpy 1.16.2
* matplotlib 3.0.3
* and Jupyter Notebook

To start, open the GeneticDrawing.ipynb and run the example code
